CONTRIBUTING

There are currently no plans to take this project much further, it does what I want. If you have issues with this code or ideas to improve it, please feel free to fork the project and send me a pull request. Contact me on discussions, I'll support you if I can.

Hacking and extending
---
- If one were to accept a slightly bigger board, say, a Wemos D1 mini (for which a configuration actually exists, because it is so much more convenient for debugging than the ESP-01), one might concievably be able to integrate a few buttons and a tiny oled display for configuration and maybe just a light sensor for automatic dimming.

- A variant for displays based on the GC72** or the older MAX7219 might be worth taking a look at.

Possible variants

Unless you are lucky and find a passable case (I bought and gutted a cheap), you might have to 3d-print one. With a few level shifters and driver transistors, one could easily turn this into a 3d-printed giant 7-segment wall clock.
